Neural Network with Backpropagation
---

# Introduction

Here is an implementation of a neural network with backpropagation.

The purpose is to implement a **simple and readable** model of what a neural network is, and how it works.

The question of **performance is out of concern**, if you are looking for performance please use appropriate tools.


# Nomenclature

| notation | meaning |
| - | - |
| **l** | index of layer |
| **nl** | index of next layer |
| **j** | index of neuron |
| **k** | index of weight |
| **nN** | number of neurons |
| **nN_l** | number of neurons of layer l |
| **nW** | number of weights |
| **nW_l** | number of weights per neuron on layer l (must be equal) |
| **nW_l_j** | number of weights of neuron j on layer l |
