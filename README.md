Neural Network with Backpropagation
---

# Introduction

Here is an implementation of a neural network with backpropagation.

The purpose is to implement a **simple and readable** model of what a neural network is, and how it works.

The question of **performance is out of concern**, if you are looking for performance please use appropriate tools.
